# n8n Workflow Overview

This project uses a no-code workflow built in n8n to automate an AI-powered Telegram chatbot.
The original workflow JSON file is not available because the n8n environment is no longer accessible.

## Workflow Steps
1. Telegram Trigger receives incoming user messages
2. User input is extracted and formatted
3. Message is sent to an AI service for processing
4. AI-generated response is received
5. Response is sent back to the user via Telegram Bot API
6. Basic error handling is implemented

## Key Concepts Used
- No-code automation
- Event-driven workflows
- API and webhook integration
- Chatbot workflow design
